# what is collaborative a-star?

If you are an expert in multi-agent pathfinding, please skip.

If you are a beginner of a-star, you may find "A_Pathfinding for Beginners.pdf" in folder "doc"  very helpful. Psudo code from wikipedia on a-star is good too.

Good! Now you are no longer a beginner.

A-star is well-suited for single agent pathfinding! But not for multi-agent pathfinding.

My project is based on David Silver's paper "Cooperative pathfinding".

If you are curious about system design, please find "report_3_system_specification.pdf" and other documentation in doc.


# how to use

In "main.cpp", I think comments are good enough for you to get started.


# (I am very sorry that I have no time to build GUI, command line use only)
