#Project Description

This repo demonstrates a C++ implementation of multi-agent pathfinding algorithm based on David Silver's 2005 paper "Cooperative Pathfinding".

The code presented here did not fully cover proposed solution of that paper, only partial of it.

For more information, please read the paper "Cooperative Pathfinfing" by David Silver. (http://www.aaai.org/Library/AIIDE/2005/aiide05-020.php)
