# What is it?
A-star, you know it well. It gives the best path from A to B.

Well, here is some c++ I wrote from scratch for multiple people finding there own path.

E.g, people No.1 goes from A1 to B1, people No.2 goes from A2 to B2... so on.

Their paths shall not collide, and this is the hardest part to code.

Based on paper "Cooperative Pathfinfing" by David Silver. (http://www.aaai.org/Library/AIIDE/2005/aiide05-020.php)
