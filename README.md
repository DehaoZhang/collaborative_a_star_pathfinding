# What is it?
A-star, you know it well. It gives the best path from A to B.

In this project, the cpp code I wrote from scratch is for multiple people finding their own path.

E.g, Alice goes from A1 to B1, Bob goes from A2 to B2... so on and so forth.

Their paths shall not collide which is the hardest part to code.

Based on paper "Cooperative Pathfinfing" by David Silver. (http://www.aaai.org/Library/AIIDE/2005/aiide05-020.php)
