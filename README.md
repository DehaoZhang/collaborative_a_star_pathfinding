Cooperative Pathfinding is a multi-agent path planning problem where agents must find non-colliding routes to separate destinations, given full information about the routes of other agents.

Based on paper "Cooperative Pathfinfing" by David Silver. (http://www.aaai.org/Library/AIIDE/2005/aiide05-020.php)
